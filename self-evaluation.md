# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- I feel pretty confident. There are still many array methods I'd like to learn which will aid in using each method

2. This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- It felt stressful. I had to utilize the searching techniques I leaned about before Mod 0 to search google for my answers. I had both types of struggles but got through it!

3. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I need to practice array methods. I will do that by researching them and running them on my own arrays and code. I need to adjust my calendar to do that

4. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- If I have any questions I will ask my cohortmates or the internet before bothering the instructor. I'm sure they're busy enough as it is.
